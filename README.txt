Maze Driver randomly generates a maze using union find. The dimensions of the desired maze must be given as command line arguments. The first argument is the number of rows, and the second argument is the number of columns.

To try Maze Driver, run MazeDriver.java # #, where the pound sign represents the rows and columns command line arguments.
